# Population Dynamics under Resource Constraints: Analytical Insights and Real World Extensions
In humanitarian crises such as natural disasters or conflicts, population survival often
 hinges on external aid delivery. The delivery of food, water, and medicine must match
 the consumption needs of the affected population. This project investigates how aid
 delivery timing and quantity affect long-term population sustainability using a logistic
 growth model constrained by dynamically changing resources.
 The project aims to answer the following question: Given a population that grows
 logistically with a carrying capacity dependent on food availability, how do the delivery
 frequency and quantity of food affect population survival over time
